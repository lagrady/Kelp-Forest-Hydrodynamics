# Kelp-Forest-Hydrodynamics

Created by Logan Grady for Moss Landing Marine Labs Master's thesis project

Background:
The goal of this project is to record hydrodynamic data from within a kelp forest to track currents, stratification, kelp forest density and stipe diameters, and highh frequency water velocity over time. This data will be used to calculate turbulent properties of the kelp forest over time, such as Richardson gradient profiles, kelp reynolds numbers, and turbulent dissipation rate in the presence of waves.

Notebooks folder:
- Directory for all python notebooks
- Each individual notebook pertains to a specific instrument or dataset, and contains the relevant script to import, organize, and clean the data
- Raw and cleaned data is available via google drive using the link:

Packages folder:
- A directory containing all relevant packages used in the notebooks
- Buoy_tools is used for the M1 mooring and NBDC station 46042
- senntinel_tools is used for the ADCP data
- vector_tools is used for the ADV data
